Note on this Documentation

This modular documentation outlines the original architecture and design vision of EIONIC; a large-scale framework intended to simulate consciousness, karmic memory, archetypal resonance, and more.
While this current phase focuses on building Resonance Quest as a starting point, I’m keeping this documentation public so that developers, thinkers, and potential collaborators can understand the bigger idea behind the system.
Not every module listed here will be implemented right away. Some may evolve, change names, or be postponed entirely.
Think of this as the blueprint. The foundation is here, but we’re starting with just the first room.
